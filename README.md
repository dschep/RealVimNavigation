# VimNavigation
[fman](https://fman.io) plugin for vim key style navigation.

## Usage
 * `shift+h` goes up a directory.
 * `shift+l` opens the currently selected directory.
 * `shift+j` moves cursor up one
 * `shift+k` moves cursor down one
 * `shift+d` Move the file to trash

I set it up using shift and the letter so that I can still type out names of files/directories and the cursor will move to them. A little less convient, but not too bad.

This is a modified version of ArrowNavigation plugin for fman.

## Installation
Download [master.zip](https://github.com/raguay/VimNavigation/archive/master.zip) and extract it to the `Plugins` subdirectory of fman's [data directory](https://fman.io/docs/customizing-fman). That is, you'll have `{data directory}/Plugins/VimNavigation-master`.
